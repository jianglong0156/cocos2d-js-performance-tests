/**
 * A brief explanation for "project.json":
 * Here is the content of project.json file, this is the global configuration for your game, you can modify it to customize some behavior.
 * The detail of each field is under it.

    // "debugMode" possible values :
    //      0 - No message will be printed.
    //      1 - cc.error, cc.assert, cc.warn, cc.log will print in console.
    //      2 - cc.error, cc.assert, cc.warn will print in console.
    //      3 - cc.error, cc.assert will print in console.
    //      4 - cc.error, cc.assert, cc.warn, cc.log will print on canvas, available only on web.
    //      5 - cc.error, cc.assert, cc.warn will print on canvas, available only on web.
    //      6 - cc.error, cc.assert will print on canvas, available only on web.

    "showFPS"       : true,
    // Left bottom corner fps information will show when "showFPS" equals true, otherwise it will be hide.

    "frameRate"     : 60,
    // "frameRate" set the wanted frame rate for your game, but the real fps depends on your game implementation and the running environment.

    "id"            : "gameCanvas",
    // "gameCanvas" sets the id of your canvas element on the web page, it's useful only on web.

    "renderMode"    : 0,
    // "renderMode" sets the renderer type, only useful on web :
    //      0 - Automatically chosen by engine
    //      1 - Forced to use canvas renderer
    //      2 - Forced to use WebGL renderer, but this will be ignored on mobile browsers

    "engineDir"     : "../../frameworks/cocos2d-html5/",
    // In debug mode, if you use the whole engine to develop your game, you should specify its relative path with "engineDir",
    // but if you are using a single engine file, you can ignore it.

    "modules"       : ["cocos2d"],
    // "modules" defines which modules you will need in your game, it's useful only on web,
    // using this can greatly reduce your game's resource size, and the cocos console tool can package your game with only the modules you set.
    // For details about modules definitions, you can refer to "../../frameworks/cocos2d-html5/modulesConfig.json".

    "jsList"        : [

    // "jsList" sets the list of js files in your game.

         * Why receive the loaded resources and the game reference.
         * Current CocosV3, makes some [wrong] assumptions:
         *   * it stores webgl texture info as well as the image content per image file.
         *   * it stores every loaded content in a singleton object. normally, loaded resources are read, transformed,
         *     (and some discarded) in the same process. For example, a plist with SpriteFrame definition, should loaded,
         *     transformed and discarded. There's no need in reloading or keeping its content in memory.
         *     This is the current case.
         *   * it assumes one loader instance and loader Scene: cc.LoaderScene
         *   * it assumes one single singleton director object instance.
         *   * it creates a polling mechanism to the DOM until the document element is created and attached. (this is
         *     very wrong). That's why the window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",... is added.
         *   * the plist defining SpriteFrames for an Image MUST be in the same directory.
         *   * treates Image objects as if they were loaded synchronously. they are ALL lazy loaded at reference time.
         *
         * New V4 version, makes some (different) assumptions:
         *
         *   * multiple director instances.
         *   * multiple game instances.
         *   * no constraints in loading/loader scene. In this sense, total freedom of multiple loaders running at the same
         *     time, and thus, loading status callback functions.
         *
         * In the new V4, a game [director, renderer, scalemanager, inputmanager, etc.] is created. In order to avoid
         * boilerplate code for loading resources, a convenience method load is supplied in the game itself.
         * This method receives the list of loaded cc.plugin.resource.Resource objects. This new version does not store
         * the resources, since it is expected to turn the Resources into in-game assets. This is something only the
         * developer knows how to do (we can't make assumption about whether a plist is a list of SpriteFrames or
         * Animations).
         * This is why, the onResourcesLoaded callback receives the game instance (for the shake of chaining, impossible
         * otherwise) and the Resources array [store them or whatever].
         *
         * It is important to allow the developer manipulate resources. For example, what if He want's to texture-pack
         * some resources, build some sprite fonts on-the-fly or use a webgl with mipmap texture.
         *
         * What if I need to load content in stages:
         *   * first resources to show a proper loading progress
         *   * in-game assets after that, etc.
         *
         * Use the AssetManager.load method to load the initial assets. Build a Scene, then call AssetManager.load
         * again to get the new content. Use loaded resouces at will.
         *
